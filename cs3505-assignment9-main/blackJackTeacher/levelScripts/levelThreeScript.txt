/ In this lesson, you will learn the basics of playing around the dealer's hand.
/ Remember in Blackjack, the only hand you have to beat is the dealers, so whatever they have in their hand should influence your decision to hit or stand.
/ The dealer's cards matter the most when dealing with what is called a "hard hand".
/ In Blackjack, there are hard and soft hands. This has to do with the Ace acting as either an 11, or 1.
/ A hand that has an Ace is considered soft, because its value can change. While a hand without one is hard, because its value is set.
/ We'll start with hard hands.
/ Here you have a hard total of 17. If you are dealt a hard 17 or higher, you don't even need to consider the dealers cards, you should always stand. lock stand

/ However, what should you do here?
/ A seven is pretty close to a 6, should you stand?
/ If you guessed stand, the correct answer is actually to hit.

/ Earlier we said you should hit if the dealer has above a six and you have 12, so then should you stay here?
/ The answer is unintuitively no, you should hit.
/ If you have a hard 12, you should only stay if the dealer has a 4, 5, or a 6.
/ Don't worry, not all hands are affected this much by the dealer.
