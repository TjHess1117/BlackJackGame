/ There's one more action you can take as the player we haven’t yet covered.
/ Let's talk about splits.
/ If you are dealt two cards of the same value, you may choose to split.
/ A split divides your hand into two one card hands that you can play off of.
/ It’s essentially like becoming two separate players, you hit until you’re ready to stand on one hand, then you move onto the next.
/ Here you received two eights. You should always split on eights, because a 16 is not a good final hand against the dealer.
/ When you split, you will have to pay to play on that second hand. You have to match your original bet to play the additional hand.
/ Go ahead and split your hand. lock split
/ Some casinos allow resplitting, meaning you would be permitted to split to a third hand if you got another 8.
/ This rule is dependent on the table though, and at ours, you may only split once
/ Both of these hands are passable. You could try to hit on the second hand, but your odds aren't great.
/ You should stand on the first hand (the one to the right). lock stand
/ You should stand on the second as well. lock stand
/ In this scenario, your 1st hand wins and your second hand loses.
/ In a casino, you would lose the bet on the losing hand, and win the bet on the winning hand.
/ The only other hard and fast rule around splits is to always split on aces. Your total if you kept hitting on the two ace hand would be only 12.
/ Which puts you in a horrible position with 16 cards that could cause you to go bust still in the deck.
/ There's lots of special scenarios where you should or shouldn’t split, but for now, just remember to always split on eights and aces!
