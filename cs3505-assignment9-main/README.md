### Purpose: The purpose of this educational app is to teach beginner-level black jack. It takes you through three levels where in the first it teaches the user the fundamentals, the second it teaches the user about splitting, and in the third it teaches the user about dealer probability and how to play around the dealer. There is also a free play mode as the last level which allows the user to put all of these lessons into practice.
